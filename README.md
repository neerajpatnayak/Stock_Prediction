Download the dataset (if not provided) and place it in the data directory.

You can use the sample dataset provided in the repository or replace it with your own financial data.
Explore the project code in Jupyter notebooks or scripts to understand each step.

Usage
You can use this project to:

Understand how LSTM models can be applied to predict stock prices.
Customize the code for your own datasets or modify the model architecture.
Gain insights into data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization techniques.
Data
The project uses historical Google stock data, typically organized in columns such as 'date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', and 'volume'. The dataset is available in the data directory.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes:

Converting the 'date' column to datetime format.
Sorting the data chronologically.
Normalizing the data to scale features appropriately.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture
The model architecture comprises LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. It is designed to capture temporal patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.

Training
The model is trained using the training sequences and labels. You can customize the number of training epochs and batch size according to your requirements.

Evaluation
Model evaluation involves assessing its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics help gauge the accuracy of the predictions.

Predictions
The project provides predictions for Google's stock prices for the next 10 days. You can visualize the predicted prices for each feature (open, high, low, volume, close) separately.
